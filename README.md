# Planning
1. Created a mock-up board.
2. Built event handlers to place Xs and Os in the squares when clicked.
3. Designed a Board prototype in JS, with functionality to keep track of players, keep track of the contents of cells, and check for victory conditions.
4. Integrated the two pieces together.
